h1. rb-libsvm -- Ruby language bindings for LIBSVM

This is a module which provides a Ruby API to the LIBSVM [1] library.
SVM is a machine learning and classification algorithm, and LIBSVM is
a popular free implementation of it, written by Chih-Chung Chang and
Chih-Jen Lin, of National Taiwan University, Taipei. See "Programming
Collective Intelligence," [2] among others, for a usage example.

Note: There exists another Ruby binding for LIBSVM, named Ruby SVM,
[3] written by Rudi Cilibrasi. (That's the one mentioned in the
libsvm documentation.) This package is not related but written
independently and from scratch.

h2. Dependencies

None.  Libsvm is bundled with the project.  Just clone and go!

Currently using libsvm version 3.1
