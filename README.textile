h1. rb-libsvm -- Ruby language bindings for LIBSVM

This is a module which provides a Ruby API to the LIBSVM [1] library.
SVM is a machine learning and classification algorithm, and LIBSVM is
a popular free implementation of it, written by Chih-Chung Chang and
Chih-Jen Lin, of National Taiwan University, Taipei. See "Programming
Collective Intelligence," [2] among others, for a usage example.

Note: There exists another Ruby binding for LIBSVM, named Ruby SVM,
[3] written by Rudi Cilibrasi. (That's the one mentioned in the
libsvm documentation.) This package is not related but written
independently and from scratch.

h2. Dependencies

rb-libsvm needs a Ruby installation including C header file and the
LIBSVM library itself.
